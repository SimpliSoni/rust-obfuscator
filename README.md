## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Advanced Obfuscation Engine**: Apply multiple transformation protocols to your Rust code, including arithmetic obfuscation, opaque predicates, string encryption, and more.  
- **Interactive Techniques Library**: An educational, interactive guide that teaches users about each obfuscation technique with live mini-demos.  
- **Live 3D Visualization**: A dynamic, atom-like 3D visualization of the code's structure and entropy using Three.js. The model reacts in real-time to the applied obfuscation level.  
- **Metrics Dashboard**: A data-rich dashboard with radial charts and metric cards to analyze obfuscation performance, security level, and code complexity.  
- **Polished UI/UX**: A sleek, lightweight interface with a neon-blue aesthetic, subtle glass morphism, and fluid animations, optimized for performance and accessibility.
